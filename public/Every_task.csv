A notification message should be displayed as per business direction: ‘The item will be held for 45 minutes / 1 hour.’”\nClarification & Aligned Responses:\nIs the wishlist intended to function like a reservation queue, meaning the stock is blocked for the user during the 45 minutes/1 hour hold period?\nResponse:- Yes, the wishlist in this case is designed to function as a temporary reservation mechanism. Upon addition to the wishlist, the item is held in the inventory system, effectively reserving stock across all active omnichannel channels for a defined duration.\n\nCould you please confirm whether the hold duration is 45 minutes or 1 hour, as both are currently mentioned?\nResponse:- Confirmed. The defined hold duration is 45 minutes, as per the latest BRD and business decision.\n\nDoes the hold period apply per instance added to the wishlist, or is it applicable to the entire SKU irrespective of quantity?\nResponse:- The hold period applies at the SKU level, per user wishlist. The quantity logic follows a first-hold-first-release protocol, applicable regardless of whether multiple instances are added.\n\nIs the system expected to automatically remove the item from the wishlist once the hold period expires?\nResponse:- Yes. Once the 45-minute hold window elapses, the system will automatically release the reserved inventory and remove the item from the wishlist, unless manually acted upon (e.g., added to cart or explicitly removed).\n\nShould this behavior apply uniformly to all users (guest, registered and logged-in, registered but not logged-in)?\nResponse:- Yes. The behavior is uniform across all user types, including guests, registered (logged-in or not). Session-based storage and email/phone cookie mapping will ensure temporary user-specific hold logic applies consistently.\n---Requirement 2: Terms and Conditions Acceptance Logic\nUser Story Extract:*“The Terms and Conditions checkbox behavior should be refined:\n1) Registered users should only be prompted to accept updated T&Cs, not on every purchase.\n2) Guest users should be prompted to accept T&Cs with every purchase attempt.”*\nClarification & Aligned Responses:\nShould all users be prompted to accept updated T&Cs?Response:-  Yes. All users — registered or guest — will be prompted to accept the T&Cs whenever a newer version is released, as per BRD guidelines. Guest users will also need to accept the T&Cs for every purchase attempt, in line with transient session behavior and legal compliance.\nIs the T&C acceptance expected to be stored at the account level for registered users?Response:-  Yes. For registered users, the system logs T&C acceptance at the account level, recording version ID, timestamp, and user ID. This ensures historical traceability and aligns with compliance requirements.\nHow is versioning or change detection of the T&Cs planned to be managed?\nResponse:-  A centralized versioning mechanism is already defined in the BRD. Each T&C document has a unique version ID, content hash, and publish timestamp, stored in the document repository. The system compares the user’s last accepted version with the current active version to trigger re-acceptance workflows.\n\n"",""by"":""sindhuja.nelaturu@bizcredence.com"",""assigned"":false,""date"":""5/14/2025, 7:04:35 PM GMT+5:30"",""resolved"":""N/A""},{""text"":""Version1 of task breakdown has been sent out for review.
